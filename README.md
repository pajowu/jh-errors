# Generative Errors

It has become kind of a meme that the jugend hackt alpaka logos have small errors in every image. This small paperjs scripts generates those automagically.

Huge thanks to [bleeptrack](https://github.com/bleeptrack) for introducing me to paper.js and publishing generators that helped me create this.
